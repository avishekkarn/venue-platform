# PROGRESS.md — The Living Project Log

**Version:** 2.0
**Status:** Approved
**Approved:** 2026-10-15
**Purpose:** The dated, append-only record of what has happened on the project. Newest first.

**How to read this file:** Read §7 (the snapshot) first. It tells you the current phase, milestone, and task. Then read the top three entries in §5.3 for recent context.

## 1. The Rules of This File

**Rule 1 — Append-only.** Entries are never edited after they are written. If an entry was wrong, a new entry corrects it, and the original is marked `CORRECTED BY ENTRY-XXXX`.

**Rule 2 — Newest first.** The most recent entry is at the top of §5.3.

**Rule 3 — One entry per session.** A session ends with exactly one entry.

**Rule 4 — Honest status.** `PASS`, `FAIL`, `BLOCKED`, or `STRUCTURAL`. `PASS` requires raw evidence. `FAIL` requires the failure's output. `BLOCKED` requires the reason. `STRUCTURAL` is used only when a document or a rule changed. A STRUCTURAL entry that only removes noise is a single STRUCTURAL entry. A STRUCTURAL entry that changes a locked decision is a FAIL entry for the change plus a STRUCTURAL entry for the resolution, per §4.

**Rule 5 — Trace every change.** Every entry names the task from `ROADMAP.md` or the document it changed.

**Rule 6 — Never invent.** Nothing is claimed without evidence.

**Rule 7 — Point forward.** Every entry ends with a **Next** line.

**Rule 8 — Cross-document check.** Every entry has a **Document Impact** section.

**Rule 9 — Compression is real.** When a phase closes, its entries move to the archive file for that phase (e.g., `PROGRESS_ARCHIVE_PHASE_2.md`) and are summarised in §5.1. Only the current phase's entries live in this file in full.

**Rule 10 — One obvious place to append.** New entries go at the top of §5.3, immediately below the `▼ APPEND NEW ENTRIES HERE ▼` marker. Nothing else in §5.3 changes.

## 2. The Entry Template

Every entry follows this structure. No section is skipped. "None" is a valid value.

ENTRY-XXXX — YYYY-MM-DD — <session title>
Status: PASS | FAIL | BLOCKED | STRUCTURAL

Task: <Task ID from ROADMAP.md, or "None (structural session)">

Summary:
<Two sentences. What was done, and what is now true that was not true before.>

Files Changed:

Path Action Purpose
Commands Run:
<Every command, with raw output in a fenced block. If a command was not run, say so.>

Acceptance Criteria Results:

# Criterion Result Evidence

Deviations from Contract:
<Anything outside the task's scope, or anything the task asked for that was not done. If none, "None".>

Noticed but Out of Scope:
<Problems or opportunities deliberately not acted on. If none, "None".>

Document Impact:

Document Affected? Reason Action
PRODUCT.md Yes / No Updated / Needs update / No change
DECISIONS.md Yes / No Updated / Needs update / No change
SYSTEM.md Yes / No Updated / Needs update / No change
BUILD.md Yes / No Updated / Needs update / No change
ROADMAP.md Yes / No Updated / Needs update / No change
PROGRESS.md Yes (this entry) Updated
Contradiction Check:
<One line. Does anything in this session contradict any decision, system description, or build rule? If yes, name it and how it was resolved. If no, "None found".>

Next:
<The exact task the next session starts with, and the specific next action.>

Awaiting Human Verification: YES | NO

## 3. The Compression Protocol

When a phase closes:
- Move every non-structural entry of that phase, verbatim, to the top of the entry log in `PROGRESS_ARCHIVE_PHASE_X.md`, preceded by a phase header line.
- Replace those entries in this file with a single summary line in §5.1 (Closed Phases).
- Keep every STRUCTURAL entry in this file regardless of which phase it belongs to. Structural entries are the project's constitutional record.
- Keep the last three entries of the closed phase in §5.3 even if they are not structural.
- When a decision is superseded: follow DECISIONS.md §6.4. The supersession generates a STRUCTURAL entry here.

## 4. The Contradiction Check

Run before a session is closed. Five questions.
- Does the session contradict a decision in DECISIONS.md?
- Does the session contradict the system's shape in SYSTEM.md?
- Does the session contradict a build rule in BUILD.md?
- Does the session contradict a fact in PRODUCT.md?
- Does the session contradict a task or status in ROADMAP.md?
If any answer is yes, the session stops. The developer resolves it. A FAIL entry records the contradiction. A follow-up STRUCTURAL entry records the resolution.

## 5. The Entry Log

### 5.1 Closed Phases

| Phase | Dates | Goal | Archive |
|-------|-------|------|---------|
| Phase 0 — The Documents | 2026-10-11 | The seven canonical documents authored and approved | `PROGRESS_ARCHIVE_PHASE_1.md` |
| Phase 1 — The Foundation | 2026-10-13 to 2026-10-15 | Repository, tooling, design tokens, base components, dev server | `PROGRESS_ARCHIVE_PHASE_1.md` |
| Phase 2 — The Data Model | 2026-10-15 to 2026-10-16 | Database schema, repositories, seed script | `PROGRESS_ARCHIVE_PHASE_2.md` |

### 5.2 The Entry Ledger

A quick index of every entry this file has ever held. Format: ENTRY-XXXX — YYYY-MM-DD — title — status — milestone — location.

| Entry | Date | Title | Status | Milestone | Location |
|-------|------|-------|--------|-----------|----------|

Next entry number: 0053.

### 5.3 Current Milestone — Phase 3 Milestone 3.1 (Session infrastructure)

New entries go immediately below the ▼ marker, newest first.

▼ APPEND NEW ENTRIES HERE ▼

## 6. The Archive Index

`PROGRESS_ARCHIVE_PHASE_1.md` contains the full text of every entry from Phase 0 and Phase 1.
`PROGRESS_ARCHIVE_PHASE_2.md` contains the full text of every entry from Phase 2.

## 7. The Current State Snapshot

Updated at the end of every session.

Current phase: Phase 3 — Authentication and Sessions.

Current milestone: Milestone 3.1 — Session infrastructure.

Current task: Task 3.1.1 — Add the password hashing service (hash and verify).

Current status: Phase 2 is closed. The seed creates a fully populated Juniper House venue with 12 tables, 8 rooms, 1 counter, 21 QR tokens, 3 categories, 10 menu items, 2 modifier groups, and 9 enabled hotel services; 0 staff (deferred to Task 3.1.2 per D-17.2); 0 orders (per D-17.3). All unit tests (43/43) and integration tests (78/78) pass. TypeScript check clean. Next task is Task 3.1.1.

## 8. How the File Evolves

The file grows by one entry per session. When a phase closes, its entries compress into a summary line in §5.1 and move to the archive file for that phase. The file never exceeds a size a session can read in seconds.
